# üçï Bella Calda la Pizza Backend API

This is a backend service for an **on-demand pizza delivery platform**, built with **FastAPI**. The system supports user and staff registrations, secure login, order management, and route optimization for delivery dispatching.

---

## Features

- **Authentication** with JWT (signup & login)
- **Order creation and tracking**
- **Staff order entry** (e.g. phone-in orders)
- **Superuser control** (view/update all orders)
- **Route optimization** for delivery drivers (planned feature)
- **Dockerized PostgreSQL** database

---

## Setup Instructions

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Docker (for DB setup)

### Install Dependencies
Dependencies can be installed via `uv`:
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

uv pip install .
```
or
```bash
uv pip install .
```
This will read the `pyproject.toml`, resolve dependencies, and install them efficiently.

Dependencies can be installed without `uv`:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---

### Set up envs
Create a `.env` file in project's root:
```env
OPENROUTESERVIE_API_KEY=<Your OpenRouteService API KEY>

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/pizza_db

APP_CONFIGS__API_V1_STR=/api/v1
APP_CONFIGS__PROJECT_NAME=bella-calda-la-pizza
```

## Setup PostgreSQL with Docker

> If you don't have Docker installed, install it from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

### Create a containerized DB:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will expose your PostgreSQL DB at:
```
postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/pizza
```

---

## Create Tables

Database tables are created during app start up (see [lifespan](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/events/#lifespan))
Create the first user:
```bash
python app/scripts/create_user.py
```

---

## Authentication

### Signup

**POST** `/auth/signup/`  
Registers a new user.

```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "full_name": "John Doe",
  "role": "user"
}
```

### Login

**POST** `/auth/login/`  
Returns a JWT token for use in protected endpoints.

```x-www-form-urlencoded
username: user@example.com
password: password123
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "access_token": "<jwt-token>",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

Use it in `Authorization` headers:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## Optimization Algorithm
Route Optimization is implemented considering:
- Order are clustered based on:
  - Location
  - Delivery time
  - Driver capacity (i.e. one driver can handle up to 10 pizzas)
- The clusters of order are sorted by time
- Given a cluster of orders, the driver's optimized route is computed
- In order to assign cluster of orders to a driver, the following factors need to be considered:
  - Optimized route computed previously
  - Driver availability (i.e. we fetch the driver's current location and compute the time to return to the pizza restaurant)
  - Pizza preparation
  - Time window due to hotness constrain: pizza must arrive within 20 minutes of beign baked

```plaintext
function assign_orders_to_drivers():
    ready_orders = fetch_unassigned_orders()
    pre_filtered_orders = filter_out_unavailable_orders(ready_orders)
    
    clusters = cluster_orders(pre_filtered_orders)
    sorted_clusters = sort_clusters_by_earliest_delivery_time(clusters)
    
    available_drivers = fetch_available_drivers_with_location()

    for each cluster in sorted_clusters:
        cluster_route = compute_optimized_route(cluster)
        latest_prep_time = estimate_latest_pizza_ready_time(cluster)
        dispatch_ready_time = max(current_time, latest_prep_time)

        best_driver = null
        lowest_cost = inf

        for each driver in available_drivers:
            driver_return_eta = estimate_driver_return_time(driver)
            driver_ready_time = current_time + driver_return_eta

            wait_time = max(0, dispatch_ready_time - driver_ready_time)
            delivery_estimates = simulate_delivery_times(cluster_route, dispatch_ready_time)

            if not satisfies_hotness_constraint(delivery_estimates, dispatch_ready_time):
                continue  // skip this driver

            cost = compute_assignment_cost(wait_time, delivery_estimates, cluster_route.total_duration)

            if cost < lowest_cost:
                best_driver = driver
                lowest_cost = cost

        if best_driver is not null:
            assign_cluster_to_driver(cluster, best_driver, dispatch_ready_time)
            mark_driver_as_unavailable(best_driver)
            update_orders_as_assigned(cluster.orders)
        else:
            defer_cluster_for_next_batch(cluster)
```
### Clustering
The Problem with Coordinate-Based Clustering (e.g. DBSCAN + Euclidean): Geographic proximity (e.g. similar lat/lon) does not always reflect true travel time or effort.
- Two addresses might be on opposite sides of a river, highway, or railway,
- Or separated by one-way streets or traffic bottlenecks,
- Yet Euclidean (or even Haversine) distance would treat them as "close."

## Order Management Endpoints (WIP)

| METHOD | ROUTE | FUNCTIONALITY | ACCESS |
|--------|-------|---------------|--------|
| POST   | `/orders/order/` | Place an order | All users |
| PUT    | `/orders/order/update/{order_id}/` | Update an order | Creator/staff |
| PUT    | `/orders/order/status/{order_id}/` | Update order status | Admin |
| DELETE | `/orders/order/delete/{order_id}/` | Delete an order | Creator/staff |
| GET    | `/orders/user/orders/` | Get user‚Äôs own orders | Auth users |
| GET    | `/orders/orders/` | List all orders | Admin |
| GET    | `/orders/orders/{order_id}/` | Retrieve any order | Admin |
| GET    | `/orders/user/order/{order_id}/` | Get user‚Äôs specific order | Auth users |

## Testing the API

You can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or `httpx`, `curl`, or Python scripts with `requests`.

Example:

```python
import requests

BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8000"

# Signup
resp = requests.post(f"{BASE_URL}/auth/signup/", json={
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "securepass",
    "full_name": "Pizza Lover",
    "role": "user"
})
print(resp.json())
```

### Unit Tests
Use pytest to run unit tests. In conftest.py, we create a session object that will be used during testing, along with its own engine, and this new engine will use a new URL for the testing database. For more details, see [Create the Engine and Session for Testing](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/tutorial/fastapi/tests/#create-the-engine-and-session-for-testing).
```bash
pytest -vv
```

## Run the App

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

```
or (prodution mode):
```bash
fastapi run app/main.py
```

---

## Roles

- **User** ‚Äì standard customer
- **Staff** ‚Äì can place/edit orders manually (e.g. phone-in)
- **Admin** ‚Äì can view/update all orders and statuses

---

## TODO
